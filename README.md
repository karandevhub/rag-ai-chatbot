# RAG AI Chatbot with Multi-Document Support

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI chatbot** developed with **Next.js** and **LangChain**. It enables users to ask questions and receive responses from a collection of documents, such as PDFs, by using advanced retrieval techniques and embeddings for accurate, context-aware answers.

## Features

- **Multi-Document Retrieval**: Supports querying across multiple document types (e.g., PDFs) for comprehensive responses.
- **Next.js and LangChain Integration**: Combines Next.js for efficient routing and UI with LangChain for intelligent document retrieval and response generation.
- **Embeddings for Improved Accuracy**: Utilizes vector embeddings to match user queries with relevant document content, ensuring high answer accuracy.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: Handles both frontend and backend, allowing for smooth UI and server-side processing.
- **LangChain**: Provides advanced document querying and response capabilities.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Powers the retrieval-augmented generation by transforming text data into vector format for precise document matching.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karandevhub/rag_ai-chatbot.git
